<p>1. <strong>Reddit is fun</strong> <img src="/blog/assets/rif.png" alt="Reddit is fun" style="width: 75px;"/></p>
<p>There are several Reddit apps out there, even an official one, but I think
this one beats them all. It provides an intuitive UI that feels familiar to
Reddit users. It also caters to those who have AMOLED screens or just want 
easier night time reading, as it supports night mode. You can filter content and easily
navigate between subreddits.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Duolingo</strong> <img src="/blog/assets/duo.png" alt="Duolingo" style="width: 75px;"/></p>
<p>This is a pretty amazing service if you're ever interested in learning a foreign language. I've
been learning German on there for about two years now and I'm about halfway through the program. If
you dedicate a lot of time to it, you can finish a program in several months. However, if you're serious 
about learning a new language, I suggest complimenting <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>
with <a href="http://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> or another language learning service.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Todoist</strong> <img src="/blog/assets/todoist.png" alt="Todoist" style="width: 75px;"/></p>
<p>Next up on the list is the productivity app, <a href="https://en.todoist.com/">Todoist.</a> I like to 
create a list of daily tasks that I need to accomplish, such as homework, projects, or even laundry. The good
thing about Todoist is that it's developed for nearly every platform, except Linux :frowning:. Another nice feature is
its integration with Alexa. I have an Echo Dot and it's always convenient to tell Alexa to add something to
my list. This short description didn't do enough justice for it, so I suggest checking out their website
to see all the features they have.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Yahoo Sports</strong> <img src="/blog/assets/yahoo.png" alt="Yahoo Sports" style="width: 75px;"/></p>
<p>There's a lot of sports apps out there, and I've tried quite a few, but I think this one edges out the rest.
Yahoo recently rebraned their sports app with a beautiful modern material design interface. You can follow your
favorite teams and it will keep you up to date with news, scores, and highlights. The app comes with
many customizable notifications, such as alerts to game starts or close game situations.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>5. <strong>Hacker News Materialistic</strong> <img src="/blog/assets/hn.png" alt="Hacker News" style="width: 75px;"/></p>
<p>This app will probably appeal more to the tech crowd. If you don't know what Hacker News is, it's basically a social
community that discusses topics of computer science and other things trending in technology. They have a 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">website </a>but I rarely visit it. I just access everything through this
 app. It's probably one of the most well-designed apps I've ever used. It makes good use of Google's material design.
To add on to that, it's ad-free and open source. There's not much else you could ask for.</p>
